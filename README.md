## app.properties Structure

The `app.properties` file is used to specify the behavior of the computer opponent. It should be placed in the root directory of the project. The file should have the following structure:

`computerBehaviour=<value>`

- `<value>` can be one of the following options:
    - `R` (Rock)
    - `P` (Paper)
    - `S` (Scissors)
    - `Random` (Computer randomly selects a move)

Example `app.properties` file:

`computerBehaviour=Random`

In this example, the computer opponent will randomly select its moves.

Feel free to experiment with different values for `computerBehaviour` to change the computer's behavior during the game.
